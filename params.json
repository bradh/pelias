","body":"Pelias is a modular open-source geocoder built on top of ElasticSearch for fast geocoding. \r\n\r\n### What's a geocoder do anyway?\r\n\r\nGeocoding is the process of transforming input text, such as an address, or a name of a placeâ€”to a location on the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n![geocode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelias/pelias/master/img/geocoding.gif)\r\n\r\n### ... and a reverse geocoder, what's that?\r\n\r\nReverse geocoding is the opposite, it transforms your current geographic location in to a list of places nearby.\r\n\r\n![reverse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelias/pelias/master/img/reverse.gif)\r\n\r\n### What makes Pelias different from other geocoders?\r\n\r\n- It's completely open-source and MIT licensed\r\n- It's based on open-data, so you can run it yourself\r\n- You can install it locally and modify to suit your needs\r\n- It has an impressive list of features, such as fast autocomplete\r\n- It's modular, so you don't need to be an expert to make changes\r\n- It's easy to install and requires no external dependencies\r\n- We run a continuous deployment cycle with a new version shipping weekly\r\n\r\n### What are the main goals of the Pelias project?\r\n\r\n- Provide accurate search results\r\n- Give users query suggestions (typeahead in the search box)\r\n- Account for location bias (places nearer to you appear higher in the results)\r\n- Support multiple data sources (OSM, geonames, quattroshapes etc)\r\n- Flexible software architecture\r\n- Easy to contribute software patches and features to\r\n- Easy to set-up and configure your own instance\r\n- No external dependencies (such as postgres)\r\n- Reliable, configurable & fast import process\r\n- Work equally well for a small city and the entire planet\r\n\r\n### How can I install my own instance of Pelias?\r\n\r\nCheck out our [vagrant development environment](https://github.com/pelias/vagrant).\r\n\r\n### I'm a developer, can I get access to the API?\r\n\r\nPelias was rebuilt from scratch and re-launched at the end of Sept '14 so the API is still in Alpha and will be subject to change for the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nYou don't need a key to access the demo API, however we are enforcing some generous rate limits. If you need help building your own Pelias server get in touch!\r\n\r\n#### /suggest\r\n\r\nThe suggest endpoint provides a super-fast autocomplete. This API can be used to quickly find location names which BEGIN with the input text.\r\n\r\nYou must provide a latitude and longitude so that the results are localised, you may additionally provide a zoom value.\r\n\r\nhttp://pelias.mapzen.com/suggest?input=big%20ben&lat=51.5&lon=-0.06\r\n![suggest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelias/pelias/master/img/suggest.gif)\r\n\r\n#### /search\r\n\r\nThe search endpoint provides a full-text search. This search is far more flexible than `/suggest`. It will try to account for spelling mistakes and will search for your input at any position in the location name.\r\n\r\nYou must provide a latitude and longitude so that the results are localised. You may additionally provide a zoom value.\r\n\r\nhttp://pelias.mapzen.com/search?input=shoreditch&lat=51.5&lon=-0.06\r\n![search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelias/pelias/master/img/search.gif)\r\n\r\n#### /reverse\r\n\r\nThe reverse endpoint returns the nearest locations to your input lat/lon.\r\n\r\nYou must provide a latitude and longitude so that the results are localised. You may additionally provide a zoom value.\r\n\r\nhttp://pelias.mapzen.com/reverse?lat=51.5&lon=-0.06\r\n![reverse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelias/pelias/master/img/reverse2.gif)\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you would like to report a problem please [open an issue](https://github.com/pelias/pelias/issues).\r\nPull requests are welcome!\r\n<span id=\"scroll_mark\"></span>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
